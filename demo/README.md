# demo

This is a demo Flutter app for showcasing the [`visa_nova_flutter`](https://github.com/visa/nova-flutter) design system library.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project serves as a runnable Flutter application for Android, iOS, and other platforms.

If you just cloned this repo and want to run the demo app, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to the demo folder

```bash
cd demo
```

### 2. Initialize platform folders (Android, iOS, web, etc.)

```bash
flutter create .
```

This will generate missing platform directories like `android/`, `ios/`, and `web/` in the current directory.

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the app on a connected device or emulator

```bash
flutter run
```

Make sure you have a device or simulator running. You can check available devices with:

```bash
flutter devices
```
